👋 Hello! I'm Hüseyin Erdem 👋

I'm currently pursuing a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I’m passionate about low-level programming, systems design, and solving complex problems using code. My main focus is on system-level programming with C, embedded systems, and mathematical modeling.

🔧 Interests:

⚡ Digital Electronics & Embedded Systems

👨‍💻 System Programming with C / C++

🔍 Algorithms and Analytical Thinking

📊 Mathematical Modeling & Simulation

🧠 Rigorous Proofs and Logical Reasoning

🎯 My goal is to bridge theory with practice through engineering-oriented projects and contribute to the open-source community. Every line of code I write is a step toward deeper understanding and mastery.
